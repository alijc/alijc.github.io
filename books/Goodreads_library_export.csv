Ng is of the generation of the teenagers in the book, while I would be the same age as the mothers.<br/><br/>Mrs Richardson seems at first to be Lady Bountiful, distributing largess to the deserving needy, but is gradually revealed to be the Witch Mother from Hell, secure in her own knowledge of what is right and proper and manipulating and controlling everyone around her.  Mia on the other hand, is a Wise Woman, a nomadic artist, poor and rootless, but with the gift of seeing the deep inner essence of everyone she meets, and the knowledge of how to prick it out to the surface.  They meet and mingle for a while, then, inevitably, clash and part ways.<br/><br/>The novel ends abruptly, with each of the teenagers pointed in a different direction.

She quoted a great deal of source material, not in the original French or Norman French or Latin, of course, but translated into English.

This allows the author to build suspense, bringing each narration to a cliff-hanger and then swapping out to a different narrator, to leave you hanging.  But it also provided some relief.

The married couples, sundered from each other by Charlotte and Amerigo's adultery, if indeed they actually consumated their affair?  Or the couples sundered from each other, as father and daughter arranged to separate the lovers and to save their own marriages?  And was the third piece - the stem - really Fanny, who had arranged both marriages and upon whom all of the relationships rested?<br/><br/>I'd downloaded the book from Gutenberg and had alternated between reading the text and plugging in my earbuds and having the mechanical voice read it to me.  Someone said that the best way to read James was to have it read to you.

What we got was a book, written by a Han Chinese, about Mongolia.  <br/><br/>About a Mongolia that no longer exists.  One in which the grassland Mongolians were still nomadic herders, shifting their herds of horses and sheep across the vast grassland, in constant battle to protect their animals from the packs of wolves, but realizing that the wolves themselves protected the health of the grassland by keeping all the herbivores in check.  <br/><br/>But during the cultural revolution, this ecological equilibrium was seen as one of the old anachronisms that needed to be swept away, along with the wolves and the marmots.  And the nomadic life.  In the end, the grassland was turned over to farming and the nomads moved to houses with fenced enclosures.  And the desert started moving in.<br/><br/>The novel is told from the point of view of Chen Zhen, a Han Chinese who has been 'invited' to move to the countryside and take up the rural life.  He works as a sheep herder, supplementing the Mongolian production brigade, and adapts to the Mongolian way of life, learning from an elder how they have survived in their inhospitable land.  He's fascinated by wolves, whom the Mongolians revere, and, perhaps after reading too much Jack London, decides to kidnap and raise a wolf cub.  The experiment works for a while, but as the cub grows he turns into a thing torn between two worlds, and able to live in neither.  He never learned to be a wolf, and cannot survive in the wild.

But with dashes of humor, to give your brain short respites between the avalanches of facts and logic.<br/><br/>I began by reading the book in the proper order, starting with an explanation of template type deduction.  (The same that I'd used in the STL in older versions of C++.  And now, after all these years, can finally say that I understand.)  From there I continued on into the new features.  But after a while I realized that there's no reason to read it in order.  Each section can stand alone.  True, there are references to other sections, but as often as not they're pointing forward in the text rather than backwards.  And, in the ebook at least, they come with handy hyperlinks so you can bounce to the reference and then right back.  So I started hopping.  Straight to the chapter on lambda functions, to see how they could possibly fit well into an OO language.  And by gum, it ended up making perfect sense.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend this book to old-fart C++ programmers who want to catch up with the new stuff.

Couldn't get the tape, or couldn't find the time?) The book did play like a Greek tragedy, where everyone's fate is preordained. (And perhaps Eugenides expected more knowledge of classical theatre in his audience than actually exists.) Evidentally, he wrote it in the first person so as to be able to use non-gender-specific pronouns, and so avoid the he/she conflicts that we readers were dealing with in thinking about Calli/Cal. Most (maybe all) of the events external to the family were real historical events that he worked into the plot. To Bill, who grew up near Detroit (but not in Gross Point), the description of the race riots was very true to life. (Now why did he expend so much energy on things like the burning of Smyrna and the riots in Detroit? Were the scenes put in to titilate the reader? Or were they merely plot devices, to get the family to embark on another move? Or are they metaphors for the transformation that the family, and ultimately Cal(i), are going through.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I thought at the beginning that it was aiming to be a survey of all religions of all times.  But it was actually only interested in the religions that had influenced Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  And of those the focus was mainly on Christianity.  Particularly the Christianity of Western Europe and the Americas. <br/><br/>One of her premises is that Biblical literalism is a recent development.  Until the later part of the 19th century everyone saw the text of the Bible as metaphors or stories, not as statements of actual historical fact.  Only after the rise of science did anyone think to look for explanations of natural phenomena in the Bible.<br/><br/>She believes in a division of spheres, in which science teaches us how the world works, and religion teaches us morality and how to live.  The product of a religious life is peace and compassion, and anyone who uses religion as an excuse to cause harm to another is guilty of idolatry, recreating God in their own image to further their own squalid ends.<br/><br/>There were a couple of statements that were new to me.  One, that Jesus was only one of many rabbis of his time embracing the new morality of the Golden Rule.  And the other was that Jesus never claimed divinity, nor did the early Christian church claim it for him.  The epithet of ""Son of God"" was often bestowed on Jewish prophets as an honor, not a mark of divinity.<br/><br/>A recurring theme of the book was that God is past knowing, defining, or describing.  We can try, and often do, but it's a fruitless quest, and in the end we falter, seeing the uselessness of words, and fall into an awestruck silence.<br/><br/>It is ironic that it took her 14 CDs and 17 hours to say this.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I found her attitude, and her humility, refreshing, in that she credited her success to sheer luck, or to the support of her many mentors, or the love of her family.  And only as an afterthought to her own intelligence or to the discipline that she was forced to learn at a young age.  (It certainly wasn't due to her parochial school upbringing, which ill-prepared her for a demanding college.)  She makes a strong argument for affirmative action, as a means to sift out the promising students who would otherwise be condemned to continued poverty.

No longer the country of Austen or Trollope, where the only acceptable fates for a young middle-class woman were either marriage (preferably financially secure) of the quasi-servant state of a governess.  By the late 19th century the first glimmerings of the women's rights movement was suggesting that, just maybe, it might be a good idea if women could earn their own living, rather than being dependent on a husband.<br/><br/>In this book the Madden sisters are products of the old society.  Brought up to be wives and mothers, they are impoverished by the death of their father and strive to eke out a living, hoping only that Monica, the youngest and prettiest of them, will save the family through a good marriage.  On the other end of the spectrum, Mary Barfoot and Rhoda Nunn are fiercely proud proto-feminists who live by their own resources and teach other women to do the same.  (Ironically, by becoming typists, which was then a man's domain.)<br/><br/>Both Monica and Rhoda make practical choices for providing for their own future.  But then, unexpectedly, love intrudes on each of them and upsets all their plans.<br/><br/>The characterizations were good.  I felt empathy for just about everyone in the book.  Which meant that I would at times like to take one by the shoulders and shake vigorously, yelling at them to not be such an ass.<br/><br/>The ending is a bit abrupt.

You got the sense that she was never truly happy after she left. But you and she also knew that there was no going back.

I was struck by how much the religion has evolved (but, oddly, with each change touted as a return to its forgotten origins), much as Christianity has, and I now wonder if this is a standard course of any religion.  He posited that the rise of the West had more to do with luck than anything else - that the Renaissance and the Enlightenment didn't happen in the Middle World simply because it was composed of stable and powerful empires at the time, and that they neither needed nor wanted the associated upheaval.  Our collective recent history comes across as a series of hideous mistakes and miscalculations, with a trail of unintended consequences.  But I wonder if anything we had done could have been acceptable, once the West gained mastery over the Muslim world.<br/><br/>One caveat.  When the author discussed events, in the West, that I knew something about, I noticed a tendency to over-generalize and leave bits out.  I assume that he was doing the same in the rest of the book.

But this time around, of course, he changed his mind.<br/><br/>She doesn't know whether Kitzhaber has read this book.  But Gary Haugen has, and asked to speak with her.  She visited him on death row and interviewed him for 2 1/2 hours.  And in the end decided that he does not have the right to ask to die.  That he owes it to the families of his victims to stay alive and answer any questions they might have about the murders.<br/><br/>And that's why she's opposed to the death penalty.  Not for the moral reasons that killing is wrong no matter who does it, or for the pragmatic ones about the financial cost of appeals and executions, or for the judicial ones about the chances of executing an innocent person.  She opposes it because of the emotional cost for the survivors.  Every step along the way reopens the wound, and the final step doesn't bring closure, but only an end of any possibility of learning about their loved ones last hours.  Only a sentence of life without parole would give the finality that might actually bring healing.<br/><br/>Ruth Ann (visiting from the other group) told about her yoga teacher, who had been a nurse during WWII and had been scooped up and sent to Auschwitz, but had been kept alive for her useful skills.  And the Nazis would come to her at the end of their shifts and ask for yoga instruction, to alleviate the stress of running the gas chambers.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

There were a number of teachers or former teachers among us. We agreed that the role of the family was important in a child's education, but disagreed about how much society should provide when the support of the family was lacking. It seems that there are pockets of poverty in Beaverton, and that there's been gerrymandering to keep those pockets from tainting the 'rich' school across the street. Nobody seems to like No Child Left Behind. (One person even thinks that it's nothing more than a government conspiracy to destroy the public school system and instead fund private schools, through vouchers.) Teaching to the test isn't really teaching. But you need to have some sort of standardized test, because the teachers won't be objective enough when grading their own students.

I finished the book, in between tending to him, but must admit to a certain level of distraction. And I took it very personally.<br/><br/>So I'm afraid that this is going to be a very self-indulgent review, wallowing in self-pity, as it were.<br/><br/>First off, Joan Didion wrote this book as a form of therapy.  This is something that I's going to have to try.  Actually, I suppose that that's what I'm doing right now.  (By another coincidence, when reading to Karl from the <i>Scientific American</i> that had just shown up in his mailbox, I came across an article on the therapeutic benefits of writing about personal experiences, theorizing that this is part of what's caused the recent explosion of blogging.)<br/><br/>Didion found solace in poetry - reading it, quoting it, looking it up - even, to some extent, writing it.  I'm finding solace in music - stuffing a piece of music, usually a hymn tune, in the back of my head and letting it loop throughout the day.<br/><br/>She also experienced denial.  (Isn't this supposed to be the first stage of grief?)<br/>I desperately hung on to the shreds of my own denial, until one of his doctors, dancing around the hard truth, told me that any possible treatment would not be 'curative'.<br/><br/>And Didion poked around in the past, looking for omens that she should have noticed.  We did that too.  He seemed fine when I last saw him, in early May.  But.  He'd been having headaches.  And he needed help in moving our parents' TV.  <br/><br/>In the end, Didion finds acceptance.  That hasn't happened to me yet and isn't likely to, not for awhile.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The men of the expedition (most of them anyway) came out bigger and more noble than the norm.  And nature tended to be portrayed as evil.
