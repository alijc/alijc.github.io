<p>START
<br>AJC 

<!--Palus erat non magna inter duo exercitus; neutri tamen initium transeundi --
  --facere volebant. -->

There was a marsh between the two armies that wasn't very large; 
but neither army was willing to be the first to cross it.

<!--Tandem Hercules signum dedit, et ubi paludem transiit, --
  --proelium commisit.-->

At last Hercules gave the signal and the battle joined
as soon as he had crossed over.

<!--Amazones impetum virorum fortissime sustinuerunt, et contra opinionem omnium
  --tantam virtutem praestiterunt ut multos eorum occiderint, 
  --multos etiam in fugam coniecerint.-->

The Amazons held off the attack of the men with great courage, and, 
counter to everyone's expectation, showed such great strength that
they slaughtered many of Hercules' men and threw even more into flight.

<!-- Viri enim novo genere pugnae perturbabantur nec magnam virtutem
  praestabant.-->

For the men were thrown into confusion by the new type of fighting 
and didn't show great courage.

<!-- Hercules autem cum haec videret, de suis fortunis desperare coepit.-->

But when Hercules saw this, he began to despair of his fortune.

<!-- Milites igitur vehementer cohortatus est ut pristinae virtutis memoriam
  retinerent neu tantum dedecus admitterent, hostiumque impetum fortiter
  sustinerent; quibus verbis animos omnium ita erexit ut multi etiam qui
  vulneribus confecti essent proelium sine mora redintegrarent.-->

Then he vehemently exhorted his soldiers to hold fast to the memory
of their original courage and not permit such a disgrace, and to bravely 
check the assault of the enemy;

With these words he roused everyone's courage so much that even
many who had been wounded renewed the fight without delay.
