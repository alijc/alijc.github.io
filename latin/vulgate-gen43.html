<!--
18 Ibique exterriti, dixerunt mutuo: Propter pecuniam, quam retulimus prius in saccis nostris, introducti sumus: ut devolvat in nos calumniam, et violenter subjiciat servituti et nos, et asinos nostros.
-->
<p>AJC And struck with terror in that place, they said to each other:
       we have been admitted on account of the money 
       which we previously carried back in our sacks:
       so that trickery might roll down onto us,
       and violently cast into servitude both ourselves and our asses.
</p>

<!--
19 Quam ob rem in ipsis foribus accedentes ad dispensatorem domus,
-->
<p>AJC On account of which, having approached up to the steward
       at the very doors of the house,
</p>

<!--
20 locuti sunt: Oramus, domine, ut audias nos. 
   Jam ante descendimus ut emeremus escas:
-->
<p>AJC they said:
       We pray, lord, that you might hear us.
       Already before we came down so that we might buy food:
</p>

<!--
21 quibus emptis, cum venissemus ad diversorium, aperuimus saccos nostros,
   et invenimus pecuniam in ore saccorum: quam nunc eodem pondere reportavimus.
-->
<p>AJC which having bought, when we had come to the inn, we opened our sacks,
       and found the money in the mouth of the sacks:
       which now the same weight we have carried back.
</p>

<!--
22 Sed et aliud attulimus argentum, ut emamus quæ nobis necessaria sunt:
   non est in nostra conscientia quis posuerit eam in marsupiis nostris.
-->
<p>AJC But we also brought other money, so that we might buy whatever we need:
       it is not within our knowledge who put it into our purses.
</p>

<!--
23 At ille respondit: Pax vobiscum, nolite timere: Deus vester, et Deus patris
   vestri, dedit vobis thesauros in saccis vestris: nam pecuniam, quam dedistis
   mihi, probatam ego habeo. Eduxitque ad eos Simeon. 
-->
<p>AJC And he replied: Peace be with you, fear not:  Your God, and the God of
       your father, gave you treasure in your sacks: for I assuredly have the
       money that you gave me.  And he led Simeon out to them.
</p>

<!--
24 Et introductis domum, attulit aquam, et laverunt pedes suos, deditque pabulum
   asinis eorum. 
-->
<p>AJC And having brought them into the house, he brought water, and they washed
       their feet, and he gave fodder to their asses.
</p>

<!--
25 Illi vero parabant munera, donec ingrederetur Joseph meridie: 
   audierant enim quod ibi comesturi essent panem. 
-->
<p>AJC Truly they prepared the gifts, until Joseph should come in at midday:
       for they heard that they might eat bread there.
</p>

<!--
26 Igitur ingressus est Joseph domum suam, obtuleruntque ei munera,
   tenentes in manibus suis: et adoraverunt proni in terram.
-->
<p>AJC Then Joseph came into his house, and they presented gifts to him,
       having held them in their hands: and they bowed down to the ground.
</p>

<!--
27 At ille, clementer resalutatis eis, interrogavit eos, dicens:
   Salvusne est pater vester senex, de quo dixeratis mihi? adhuc vivit?
-->
<p>AJC But he, greeting them mildly, questioned them, saying:
       Is your old father, of whom you spoke to me, well?  Does he still live?
</p>

<!--
28 Qui responderunt: Sospes est servus tuus pater noster, adhuc vivit.
   Et incurvati, adoraverunt eum.
-->
<p>AJC And they replied: 
       Thy servant our father is safe and sound, he yet lives.
       And bending down, they paid him homage.
</p>

<!--
29 Attollens autem Joseph oculos, vidit Benjamin fratrem suum uterinum, et ait:
   Iste est frater vester parvulus, de quo dixeratis mihi? Et rursum: Deus,
   inquit, misereatur tui, fili mi. 
-->
<p>AJC Then Joseph, lifting up his eyes, saw Benjamin his brother of the
       same womb, and said: Is this your young brother, of whom you spoke to me?
       And again he said: God show thee mercy, my son.
</p>

<!--
30 Festinavitque, quia commota fuerant viscera ejus super fratre suo, 
   et erumpebant lacrimæ: et introiens cubiculum flevit. 
-->
<p>AJC And he hastened away, because his guts had been moved about his brother,
       and tears sprang forth: and entering his bed chamber, he wept.
</p>

<!--
31 Rursumque lota facie egressus, continuit se, et ait: Ponite panes.
-->
<p>AJC And again, having come out with a washed face, he restrained himself,
       and said: Serve the bread.
</p>

<!--
32 Quibus appositis, seorsum Joseph, et seorsum fratribus, Ægyptiis quoque qui
   vescebantur simul, seorsum (illicitum est enim Ægyptiis comedere cum Hebræis,
   et profanum putant hujuscemodi convivium) 
-->
<p>AJC When it been served up, separately to Joseph and to his brothers, and to
       the Egyptians, each one ate at the same time, but separately
       (for it is forbidden for Egyptians to eat with Jews, 
        and they think this sort of feast profane)
</p>

<!--
33 sederunt coram eo, primogenitus juxta primogenita sua, et minimus juxta
   ætatem suam. Et mirabantur nimis, 
-->
<p>AJC they sat in his presence, the firstborn according to his birthright, 
       and the youngest according to his age.
</p>

<!--
34 sumptis partibus quas ab eo acceperant: majorque pars venit Benjamin, ita ut
   quinque partibus excederet. Biberuntque et inebriati sunt cum eo. 
-->
<p> AJC the selected portion that they had accepted from him: 
        and the greater part went to Benjamin, so that it exceeded five parts.
        And they drank and got drunk with him.
</p>
