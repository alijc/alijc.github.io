<!--SenAtum coEgI. IntrOdUxI Volturcium sine GallIs. -->

I convened the senate.  I led in Volturcius, without the Gauls.
I gave him immunity.
I urged him to relate that which he knew without fear.
Then he, when he had revived out of his terror,
said that he had an order frmo Lentulus to Catiline
to use the help of slaves
and to approach the city forthwith with infantry.
Then the Gauls were led in, and they said 
that they had been given letters to their tribe from Lentulus 
and he ordered them to send cavalry into Italy forthwith.
In the end, when the whole affair had been exposed, 
the senate decreed that the conspirators, 
who had undertaken this treachery, be delivered into custody.
