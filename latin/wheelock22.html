<!-- PoEtae per litterAs hominibus magnam perpetuamque fAmam dare possunt;

  -- Trahimur omnEs studiO laudis et multI glOriA dUcuntur, 
  -- quae aut in litterIs GraecIs aut LatInIs invenIrI potest. 
  -- QuI, autem, videt multum frUctum glOriae in versibus

Through literature, poets can give great and everlasting fame to men;
Many men, therefore, desire accounts to be written about their affairs.
We all are drawn by zeal for praise and many men are led by fame,
which can be found in either Greek or Latin literature.
Whoever, however, sees great reward of fame in Latin verses
but not in Greek ones, errs beyond measure,
for Greek literature is read in almost all nations,
but Latin literature is contained within our own borders.
