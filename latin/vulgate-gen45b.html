<p>AJC
<!-- 15 Osculatusque est Joseph omnes fratres suos, -->
And Joseph kissed all his brothers,
<!-- et ploravit super singulos: post quæ ausi sunt loqui ad eum.-->
and wept over each one: and after that they dared to speak to him.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 16 Auditumque est, et celebri sermone vulgatum in aula regis: -->
And he heard them, and an oft-repeated rumor was spread in the king's palace:
<!--Venerunt fratres Joseph: et gavisus est Pharao, atque omnis familia ejus.-->
Joseph's brothers have come: and Pharaoh rejoiced, and all his family.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 17 Dixitque ad Joseph ut imperaret fratribus suis, dicens: -->
And he said to Joseph that he should command his brothers, saying:
<!-- Onerantes jumenta, ite in terram Chanaan,-->
Having loaded your mules, go into the land of Canaan,
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 18 et tollite inde patrem vestrum et cognationem, et venite ad me: -->
and take your father and his kindred away from there, and come to me:
<!-- et ego dabo vobis omnia bona Ægypti, ut comedatis medullam terræ.-->
and I will give you all good things of Egypt, so that you might eat 
the marrow of the land.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 19 Præcipe etiam ut tollant plaustra de terra Ægypti, -->
And tell them to take carts from the land of Egypt,
<!-- ad subvectionem parvulorum suorum ac conjugum: et dicito: -->
for transporting their little ones and spouses: and say:
<!-- Tollite patrem vestrum, et properate quantocius venientes.-->
Take your father away, and hurry and come as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 20 Nec dimittatis quidquam de supellectili vestra: -->
And do not leave any of your household stuff:
<!-- quia omnes opes Ægypti vestræ erunt.-->
because all the wealth of Egypt will by yours.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 21 Feceruntque filii Israël ut eis mandatum fuerat. -->
And the sons of Israel did as he had commanded them.
<!-- Quibus dedit Joseph plaustra, secundum Pharaonis imperium, -->
Joseph gave them carts, according to Pharaoh's command,
<!-- et cibaria in itinere.-->
and provisions for the journey.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 22 Singulis quoque proferri jussit binas stolas: -->
He ordered a pair of garments to be brought forth for each and every man:
<!-- Benjamin vero dedit trecentos argenteos cum quinque stolis optimis:-->
But to Benjamin he truly gave 300 silver coins with 5 garments of the best sort:
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 23 tantumdem pecuniæ et vestium mittens patri suo, -->
sending as much money and clothing to his father,
<!-- addens et asinos decem, qui subveherent ex omnibus divitiis Ægypti, -->
and adding 10 he-asses, that might convey from all the riches of Egypt,
<!-- et totidem asinas, triticum in itinere, panesque portantes.-->
and as many she-asses, for carrying wheat and bread for the journey.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 24 Dimisit ergo fratres suos, et proficiscentibus ait: -->
Then he sent his brothers away, and said as they were setting out:
<!-- Ne irascamini in via.-->
Don't be angry on the way.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 25 Qui ascendentes ex Ægypto, -->
And they, going up out of Egypt,
<!-- venerunt in terram Chanaan ad patrem suum Jacob.-->
came into the land of Canaan to their father Jacob.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 26 Et nuntiaverunt ei, dicentes: Joseph filius tuus vivit: -->
And they brought word to him, saying: Joseph thy son lives:
<!-- et ipse dominatur in omni terra Ægypti. -->
and himself rules in the whole land of Egypt.
<!--Quo audito Jacob, quasi de gravi somno evigilans, tamen non credebat eis.-->
When Jacob had heard this, as if waking from a heavy sleep, 
he nonetheless didn't believe them.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 27 Illi e contra referebant omnem ordinem rei. -->
They on the contrary reported on the entire order of the king.
<!-- Cumque vidisset plaustra et universa quæ miserat, revixit spiritus ejus,-->
And when he had seen the carts and all that he had sent, 
it revived his spirit,
</p>

<p>AJC
<!-- 28 et ait: -->
and he said:
<!-- Sufficit mihi si adhuc Joseph filius meus vivit: -->
It is enough for me if my son Joseph yet lives:
<!-- vadam, et videbo illum antequam moriar.-->
I will go and see him before I die.
