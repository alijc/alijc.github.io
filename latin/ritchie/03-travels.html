<h3>3. PERSEUS IS SENT ON HIS TRAVELS</h3>
<p>
Perseus igitur multōs annōs ibi habitābat, et cum mātre suā vītam
beātam agēbat. At Polydectēs Danaën magnopere amābat, atque
eam in mātrimōnium ducere volēbat. Hoc tamen cōnsilium Perseō
minimē grātum erat. Polydectes igitur Perseum dimittere cōnstituit.
Tum iuvenem ad sē vocāvit et haec dīxit: "Turpe est hanc ignāvam
vītam agere; iam dūdum tū adulēscēns es. Quō ūsque hīc manēbis?
Tempus est arma capere et virtūtem praestāre. Hinc abī, et caput
Medūsae mihi refer.”

And so Perseus lived there for many years, and led a happy life with his
mother. But Polydectes had a burning desire for Danae, and wanted to marry her.
Yet this plan wasn't at all pleasing to Perseus.  Therefore Polydectes resolved
to send Perseus away.  Then he called the youth to him and said these things:
"It is shameful to lead this idle life; you are now a young man.  Why do you
still stay here?  It's time to take up arms and show your manliness.  Depart
from here, and bring me back the head of Medusa.
