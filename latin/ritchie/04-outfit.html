<h3>4. PERSEUS GETS HIS OUTFIT</h3>
<p>
Perseus ubi haec audīvit, ex īnsulā discessit, et postquam ad
continentem vēnit, Medūsam quaesīvit. Diū frustrā quaerēbat;
namque natūram locī ignorābat. Tandem Apollō et Minerva viam
dēmōnstrāvērunt. Prīmum ad Graeās, sorōrēs Medūsae, pervēnit.
Ab hīs tālāria et galeam magicam accēpit. Apollo autem et
Minerva falcem et speculum dedērunt. Tum postquam tālāria
pedibus induit, in āēra ascendit. Diū per āēra volābat; tandem
tamen ad eum locum vēnit ubi Medūsa cum cēterīs Gorgonibus
habitābat. Gorgonēs autem mōnstra erant speciē horribilī; capita
enim eārum anguibus omninō contēcta erant. Manūs etiam ex aere 
factae erant.

When Perseus heard these words, he left the island and, after he came
to the mainland, sought Medusa.  For a long time he searched in vain;
insomuch as he knew not the nature of the place.  In the end Apollo 
and Minerva showed him the way.

First off, he came to the Graeae, the sisters of Medusa.
From these he took winged sandals and a magic helmet.
While Apollo and Minerva furnished him with a scythe and a mirror.
Then, after he put the sandals on his feet, he ascended into the air.
For a long time he flew through the air; but finally he came to the place
where Medusa lived with the rest of the Gorgons.
Now the Gorgons where monsters of a dreadful sort;
for their heads were entirely covered with serpents.
Furthermore their hands were made of bronze.
