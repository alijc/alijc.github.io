<h3>JUPITER SAVES HIS SON</h3>
<p>
Iuppiter tamen haec omnia vīdit, et fīlium suum servāre cōnstituit.
Tranquillum igitur fēcit mare, et arcam ad īnsulam Seriphum
perdūxit. Huius īnsulae Polydectēs tum rex erat. Postquam arca ad
lītus appulsa est, Danaë in harēnā quietem capiēbat. Post breve
tempus ā piscātore quōdam reperta est, et ad domum rēgis
Polydectis adducta est. Ille mātrem et puerum benignē excēpit, et
eīs sedem tūtam in fīnibus suīs dedit. Danaë hoc dōnum libenter
accēpit, et prō tantō beneficiō rēgī gratiās ēgit.

Yet Jupiter saw all these things, and resolved to preserve his son.
Therefore he quieted the sea, and led the ark to the island of Seriphus,
where Polydectes was then king.  After the ark had been driven to the shore,
Danae rested on the beach.  In a little while she was found by a certain
fisherman, and taken to the house of King Polydectes.  He kindly welcomed 
mother and child, and gave them a home within his borders.  Danae willingly
accepted this gift, and gave thanks to the king for such a kindness.
