AJC 

<!--His viris Hercules persuasit, postquam causam itineris exposuit, 
ut secum iter facerent. -->

After Hercules explained the reason for the journey to these men, he
 convinced them to travel with him.  

<!--Tum cum iis quibus persuaserat navem conscendit,
 et cum ventus idoneus esset,
 post paucos dies ad ostium fluminis Thermodontis appulit. -->

Then, along with the men that he had persuaded, he boarded the ship,
and, when the wind was favorable,
after a few days he put ashore at the mouth of the River Thermodon.

<!--Postquam in finis Amazonum venit, nuntium ad Hippolytam misit,
 qui causam veniendi doceret et balteum posceret.-->

After that he came to the country of the Amazons, 
and sent a messenger to Hippolyte,
to explain the reason for his arrival and to demand the girdle.

<!--Ipsa Hippolyte balteum tradere volebat,
 quod de Herculis virtute famam acceperat;
 reliquae tamen Amazones ei persuaserunt ut negaret.-->

Hippolyte herself wished to hand over the girdle,
because she had heard report of Hercules' strength;
but the rest of the Amazons persuaded her to refuse.

<!-- At Hercules, cum haec nuntiata essent,
 belli fortunam temptare constituit.-->

When these things had been related to Hercules,
he resolved to try the fortune of war.

<!--Proximo igitur die cum copias eduxisset,
 locum idoneum delegit et hostis ad pugnam evocavit.-->

Therefore, on the next day he marched out with his troops.
He chose a suitable place and called the enemy out to battle.

<!-- Amazones quoque copias suas ex castris eduxerunt
 et non magno intervallo ab Hercule aciem instruxerunt.-->

The Amazons likewise marched their troops out of their fortress
and drew up a battle array not far from Hercules.
