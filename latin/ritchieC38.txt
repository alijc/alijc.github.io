38. 10th LABOR: THE OXEN OF GERYON

Tum vērō missus est Herculēs ad īnsulam Erythēam, ut bovēs
Gēryonis arcesseret. Rēs erat summae difficultātis, quod bovēs ā
quōdam Eurytiōne et ā cane bicipite custōdiēbantur. Ipse autem
Gēryon speciem horribilem praebēbat; tria enim corpora inter sē
coniuncta habēbat. Herculēs tamen etsī intellegēbat quantum
perīculum esset, negōtium suscēpit; ac postquam per multās terrās
iter fēcit, ad eam partem Libyae pervēnit quae Eurōpae proxima
est. Ibi in utrōque litore fretī quod Eurōpam ā Libyā dīvidit
columnās cōnstituit, quae posteā Herculis Columnae appellābantur.

Then indeed Hercules was sent to the island of Erythia, to fetch
the oxen of Geryon.  This business was extremely difficult,
because the oxen were guarded by a certain Eurytion and his
two-headed dog.  Now Geryon himself presented a horrible sight;
for he had three bodies joined together.  Nevertheless, Hercules,
although he understood how great the danger was, accepted the
task; and after he had journeyed through many countries, reached
that part of Libya which is closest to Europe.  There on each
shore of the strait that divides Europe from Libya he erected
pillars, that were later called the pillars of Hercules.
