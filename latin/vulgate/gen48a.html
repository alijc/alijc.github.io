<p>AJC
<!--1 His ita transactis, nuntiatum est Joseph quod ægrotaret pater suus:-->
<!-- qui, assumptis duobus filiis Manasse et Ephraim, ire perrexit.-->
When this had been settled, it was reported to Joseph that his father was ill:
and he took up his two sons, Manasses and Ephraim, and set out.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--2 Dictumque est seni:-->
<!-- Ecce filius tuus Joseph venit ad te.-->
<!-- Qui confortatus sedit in lectulo.-->
And they said to the old man:
Lo, thy son Joseph is coming to thee.
And he drew strength and sat up in bed.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--3 Et ingresso ad se ait:-->
<!-- Deus omnipotens apparuit mihi in Luza, quæ est in terra Chanaan:-->
<!-- benedixitque mihi,-->
And after he had come in he said to him:
The almighty God appeared to me in Luza, in the land of Canaan:
and blessed me,
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--4 et ait: Ego te augebo et multiplicabo,-->
<!-- et faciam te in turbas populorum:-->
<!-- daboque tibi terram hanc,-->
<!-- et semini tuo post te in possessionem sempiternam.-->
and said: I will increase thee and multiply thee,
and will make thee into crowds of people:
and I will give this land to thee,
and to thy seed in everlasting possession after thee.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--5 Duo ergo filii tui, qui nati sunt tibi in terra Ægypti-->
<!-- antequam huc venirem ad te, mei erunt:-->
<!-- Ephraim et Manasses, sicut Ruben et Simeon reputabuntur mihi.-->
Therefore thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt
before I came here to thee, will be my own:
Ephraim and Manasses, just as Ruben and Simeon will be counted as mine.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--6 Reliquos autem quos genueris post eos, tui erunt,-->
<!-- et nomine fratrum suorum vocabuntur in possessionibus suis.-->
But the rest, that thou begets after them, will be thine,
and they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--7 Mihi enim, quando veniebam de Mesopotamia,-->
<!-- mortua est Rachel in terra Chanaan in ipso itinere,-->
<!-- eratque vernum tempus: et ingrediebar Ephratam,-->
<!-- et sepelivi eam juxta viam Ephratæ,-->
<!-- quæ alio nomine appellatur Bethlehem.-->
For me, when I was coming from Mesopotamia,
Rachel died in the land of Canaan while on the journey.
It was in the spring: and I was going to Ephrata,
and I buried her beside the road to Ephrata,
which is also called Bethlehem.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--8 Videns autem filios ejus dixit ad eum: Qui sunt isti?-->
But when he saw Joseph's sons he said to him: Who are these?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--9 Respondit: Filii mei sunt, quos donavit mihi Deus in hoc loco.-->
<!-- Adduc, inquit, eos ad me, ut benedicam illis.-->
He answered: They are my sons, that God gave to me in this place.
Bring them to me, he said, that I might bless them.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--10 Oculi enim Israël caligabant præ nimia senectute,-->
<!-- et clare videre non poterat.-->
<!-- Applicitosque ad se, deosculatus et circumplexus eos,-->
For Israel's eyes had clouded over, because of his extreme age,
and he could not see clearly.
And when they had been brought near, he kissed them warmly and embraced them,
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--11 dixit ad filium suum: Non sum fraudatus aspectu tuo:-->
<!-- insuper ostendit mihi Deus semen tuum.-->
and said to his son: I am not cheated of thy sight:
moreover God has shown thy seed to me.
