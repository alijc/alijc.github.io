<p>AJC
<!--1 Initium Evangelii Jesu Christi, Filii Dei.-->
The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--2 Sicut scriptum est in Isaia propheta:
 [Ecce ego mitto angelum meum ante faciem tuam,
 qui præparabit viam tuam ante te.-->
As it was written in the prophet Isaiah:
Behold I send my angel before thy face,
who will prepare thy way before thee.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--3 Vox clamantis in deserto:
 Parate viam Domini, rectas facite semitas ejus.]-->
A voice crying in the wilderness:
Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make ye his paths straight.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--4 Fuit Joannes in deserto baptizans, 
et prædicans baptismum pœnitentiæ in remissionem peccatorum.-->
John was baptising in the wilderness,
and preaching the baptism of repentance in forgiveness of sins.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--5 Et egrediebatur ad eum omnis Judææ regio, et Jerosolymitæ universi,
 et baptizabantur ab illo in Jordanis flumine, confitentes peccata sua.-->
And everyone in the land of Judea came out to him, and everyone from
Jerusalem, and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing their
sins. 
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--6 Et erat Joannes vestitus pilis cameli,
 et zona pellicea circa lumbos ejus,
 et locustas et mel silvestre edebat.-->
And John was dressed in camel hair,
and a belt of leather around his loins,
and he ate locusts and wild honey.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--7 Et prædicabat dicens:
 Venit fortior post me,
 cujus non sum dignus procumbens solvere corrigiam calceamentorum ejus.-->
And he preached, saying:
There comes after me one who is mightier,
whose shoelaces I am not worthy to lean down and untie.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--8 Ego baptizavi vos aqua, ille vero baptizabit vos Spiritu Sancto.-->
I have baptized you with water, that one will truly baptize you with the Holy
Spirit. 
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--9 Et factum est:
 in diebus illis venit Jesus a Nazareth Galilææ:
 et baptizatus est a Joanne in Jordane.-->
And it was done:
in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee:
and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--10 Et statim ascendens de aqua, vidit cælos apertos,
 et Spiritum tamquam columbam descendentem, et manentem in ipso.-->
And just as he rose up out of the water, he saw the opened heavens,
and the Spirit descending like a dove, and remaining on him.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--11 Et vox facta est de cælis:
 Tu es Filius meus dilectus, in te complacui.-->
And a voice was produced from the heavens:
Thou are my beloved Son, I did please in thee.
(This would make more sense to me if it was passive.)
