<p>AJC
<!--1 Vocavit autem Jacob filios suos, et ait eis:-->
<!--Congregamini, ut annuntiem quæ ventura sunt vobis in diebus novissimis.-->
Then Jacob called his sons, and said to them:
Gather up, and I'll tell you what's going to happen to you in the last days.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--2 [Congregamini, et audite, filii Jacob,-->
<!--audite Israël patrem vestrum:-->
Gather up, and listen, children of Jacob,
listen to your father Israel:
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--3 Ruben, primogenitus meus,-->
<!--tu fortitudo mea, et principium doloris mei;-->
<!--prior in donis, major in imperio.-->
Ruben, my firstborn,
thou are my strength, and the begining of my sorrow;
leading in gifts, greater in command.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--4 Effusus es sicut aqua, non crescas: quia ascendisti cubile patris tui,-->
<!--et maculasti stratum ejus.-->
Thou has been poured out like water, may thou not increase: 
for thou climbed into thy father's bed,
and dishonored his couch.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--5 Simeon et Levi fratres-->
<!--vasa iniquitatis bellantia.-->
Brothers Simeon and Levi are
vessels of iniquity waging war.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--6 In consilium eorum non veniat anima mea,-->
<!--et in cœtu illorum non sit gloria mea:-->
<!--quia in furore suo occiderunt virum,-->
<!--et in voluntate sua suffoderunt murum.-->
Let not my soul come into their counsel,
and my glory not be in their company:
for in their rage they killed a man,
and by their will they undermined a wall.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--7 Maledictus furor eorum, quia pertinax:-->
<!--et indignatio eorum, quia dura:-->
<!--dividam eos in Jacob,-->
<!--et dispergam eos in Israël.-->
Cursed be their rage, because it is obstinate:
and their indignation, for it is hard:
I will separate them in Jacob,
and scatter them in Israel.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--8 Juda, te laudabunt fratres tui:-->
<!--manus tua in cervicibus inimicorum tuorum,-->
<!--adorabunt te filii patris tui.-->
Juda, thy brothers will praise thee: 
thy hand will be upon thy enemies' neck,
the sons of thy father will worship thee.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--9 Catulus leonis Juda:-->
<!--ad prædam, fili mi, ascendisti:-->
<!--requiescens accubuisti ut leo,-->
<!--et quasi leæna: quis suscitabit eum?-->
A lion cub is Juda:
he has climbed up to the prey:
he has lain down, resting, like a lion,
and like a lioness: who will rouse him?
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--10 Non auferetur sceptrum de Juda,-->
<!--et dux de femore ejus,-->
<!--donec veniat qui mittendus est,-->
<!--et ipse erit expectatio gentium.-->
The scepter will not be taken from Juda,
or the general from his thigh,
let him come until the one who will be sent,
and himself will be the expectation of the people.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--11 Ligans ad vineam pullum suum,-->
<!--et ad vitem, o fili mi, asinam suam,-->
<!--lavabit in vino stolam suam-->
<!--et in sanguine uvæ pallium suum.-->
Tying his chicken(?!) to the vine,
and his ass, oh my son, to the grape vine,
he will wash his garmet in wine
and his cloak in the blood of the grape.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--12 Pulchriores sunt oculi ejus vino,-->
<!--et dentes ejus lacte candidiores.-->
His eyes are more beautiful than wine,
and his teeth whiter than milk.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--13 Zabulon in littore maris habitabit,-->
<!--et in statione navium-->
<!--pertingens usque ad Sidonem.-->
Zabulon will live on the sea shore,
and at a naval station
reaching as far as to Sidon.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--14 Issachar asinus fortis-->
<!--accubans inter terminos.-->
Issachar is a strong ass
lying between the boundaries.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--15 Vidit requiem, quod esset bona-->
<!--et terram, quod optima:-->
<!--et supposuit humerum suum ad portandum,-->
<!--factusque est tributis serviens.-->
He saw rest, that it was good
and the land, that it was the best:
and put his shoulder to what needed to be done,
and was made a slave to tributes.
</p>

<p>AJC 
<!--16 Dan judicabit populum suum-->
<!--sicut et alia tribus in Israël.-->
Dan will judge his people
even as the other tribes in Israel.
</p>
