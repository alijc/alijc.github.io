<p>AJC
<!--12 Cumque tulisset eos Joseph de gremio patris,
    adoravit pronus in terram.-->
And after Joseph had lifted them from his father's lap,
he worshipped, facedown on the ground.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--13 Et posuit Ephraim ad dexteram suam, id est, ad sinistram Israël:-->
<!-- Manassen vero in sinistra sua,-->
<!-- ad dexteram scilicet patris, applicuitque ambos ad eum.-->
And he put Ephraim on his right hand, that is, on Israel's left:
and Manasses on his left hand, 
to his father's right, and brought both near to Jacob.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--14 Qui extendens manum dexteram,-->
<!-- posuit super caput Ephraim minoris fratris:-->
<!-- sinistram autem super caput Manasse qui major natu erat,
     commutans manus.-->
And he, putting forth his right hand, 
put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger brother:
and the left on the head of Manasses, who was the elder by birth,
rearranging his hands.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--15 Benedixitque Jacob filiis Joseph, et ait:-->
<!-- Deus, in cujus conspectu ambulaverunt patres mei Abraham, et Isaac;-->
<!-- Deus qui pascit me ab adolescentia mea usque in præsentem diem:-->
And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said:
God, in whose sight Abraham and Isaac, my forefathers, sojourned;
God, who has fed me from my youth up to the present day:
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--16 angelus, qui eruit me de cunctis malis, benedicat pueris istis:-->
<!-- et invocetur super eos nomen meum,-->
<!-- nomina quoque patrum meorum Abraham et Isaac,-->
<!-- et crescant in multitudinem super terram.-->
let the angel, who plucked me up from everything evil, bless these boys:
and let my name be invoked upon them,
likewise the names of my forefathers Abraham and Isaac,
and let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--17 Videns autem Joseph-->
<!-- quod posuisset pater suus dexteram manum super caput Ephraim,-->
<!-- graviter accepit:-->
<!-- et apprehensam manum patris levare conatus est de capite Ephraim,-->
<!-- et transferre super caput Manasse.-->
But when Joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on Ephraim's head,
he took it ill:
and seized his father's hand and tried to lift it from Ephraim's head
and move it unto Manasses'.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--18 Dixitque ad patrem: Non ita convenit, pater:-->
<!-- quia hic est primogenitus, pone dexteram tuam super caput ejus.-->
And he said to his father: It is fit thus, father:
because this one is the first-born, put thy right hand on his head.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--19 Qui renuens, ait: Scio, fili mi, scio:-->
<!-- et iste quidem erit in populos, et multiplicabitur:-->
<!-- sed frater ejus minor, major erit illo:-->
<!-- et semen illius crescet in gentes.-->
And he refused, saying: I know, my son, I know:
and indeed this one will become into crowds, and will be multiplied:
but his younger brother, will be greater yet:
and his seed will increase into nations.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--20 Benedixitque eis in tempore illo, dicens:-->
<!-- In te benedicetur Israël, atque dicetur:-->
<!-- Faciat tibi Deus sicut Ephraim, et sicut Manasse.-->
<!-- Constituitque Ephraim ante Manassen.-->
And he blessed them then, saying:
In thee Israel will be blessed, and it will be said:
Let God create for thee one like Ephraim, and like Manasses.
And he placed Ephraim before Manasses.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--21 Et ait ad Joseph filium suum: En ego morior, et erit Deus vobiscum,-->
<!-- reducetque vos ad terram patrum vestrorum.-->
And he said to his son Joseph: Behold, I die, and God will be with you.
and He will restore you to the land of your fathers.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--22 Do tibi partem unam extra fratres tuos,-->
<!-- quam tuli de manu Amorrhæi in gladio et arcu meo.-->
I give to thee one share outside of thy brothers,
as I brought from the hand of Amorites with my sword and bow.
