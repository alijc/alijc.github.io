<p>AJC
<!--14 Reversusque est Joseph in Ægyptum cum fratribus suis,-->
<!-- et omni comitatu, sepulto patre.-->
And Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and his whole company after
burying his father.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--15 Quo mortuo, timentes fratres ejus, et mutuo colloquentes:-->
<!-- Ne forte memor sit injuriæ quam passus est,-->
<!-- et reddat nobis omne malum quod fecimus,-->
Now that he was dead his brothers were afraid and said among themselves:
Lest Joseph perhaps be mindful of the wrong that he endured,
and pay us back for all the evil that we brought about.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--16 mandaverunt ei dicentes: Pater tuus præcepit nobis antequam moreretur,-->
they commanded him, saying:  Before he died thy father instructed us,
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--17 ut hæc tibi verbis illius diceremus:-->
<!-- Obsecro ut obliviscaris sceleris fratrum tuorum,-->
<!-- et peccati atque malitiæ quam exercuerunt in te:-->
<!-- nos quoque oramus ut servis Dei patris tui dimittas iniquitatem hanc.-->
<!-- Quibus auditis flevit Joseph.-->
to say this to thee, with these words:
I beseech thee to forget thy brothers' crime,
and the sin and wickedness that they imposed on thee:
likewise we pray that thou let go of this iniquitity by the servants of the God
of thy father.
And when he heard this, Joseph wept.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--18 Veneruntque ad eum fratres sui:-->
<!-- et proni adorantes in terram, dixerunt: Servi tui sumus.-->
And his brothers came to him:
and falling flat on the ground, said: We are thy servants.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--19 Quibus ille respondit:-->
<!-- Nolite timere: num Dei possumus resistere voluntati?-->
And he answered them: 
Fear not: can we really withstand the will of God?
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--20 Vos cogitastis de me malum:-->
<!-- sed Deus vertit illud in bonum,-->
<!-- ut exaltaret me, sicut in præsentiarum cernitis,-->
<!-- et salvos faceret multos populos.-->
You intended evil with regard to me:
but God turned that into good,
to raise me up, as you now see,
and to make many people safe.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--21 Nolite timere: ego pascam vos et parvulos vestros:-->
<!-- consolatusque est eos, et blande ac leniter est locutus.-->
Fear not: I will feed you and your little ones:
and he consoled them, and spoke gently and mildly.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--22 Et habitavit in Ægypto cum omni domo patris sui:-->
<!-- vixitque centum decem annis.-->
<!-- Et vidit Ephraim filios usque ad tertiam generationem.-->
<!-- Filii quoque Machir filii Manasse nati sunt in genibus Joseph.-->
And he dwelt in Egypt with all of his father's house:
and lived 110 years.
And saw the sons of Ephraim up to the third generation.
Likewise the sons of Machir the son of Manassus were born on Joseph's
knees. 
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--23 Quibus transactis, locutus est fratribus suis:-->
<!-- Post mortem meam Deus visitabit vos,-->
<!-- et ascendere vos faciet de terra ista-->
<!-- ad terram quam juravit Abraham, Isaac et Jacob.-->
After these things had happened, he said to his brothers:
After my death God will visit you,
and cause you to go up out of this land
to the land that he swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--24 Cumque adjurasset eos atque dixisset:-->
<!-- Deus visitabit vos, asportate ossa mea vobiscum de loco isto:-->
And when he had sworn to them and had said:
God will visit you, carry my bones away from this place with you:
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--25 mortuus est, expletis centum decem vitæ suæ annis.-->
<!-- Et conditus aromatibus, repositus est in loculo in Ægypto.-->
he died, having completed 110 years of his life.
And after being embalmed, was laid to rest in Egypt.
