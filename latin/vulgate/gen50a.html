<p>AJC
<!--1 Quod cernens Joseph, ruit super faciem patris, flens et deosculans eum.-->
When Joseph saw this, he fell upon his father's face, weeping and kissing him.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--2 Præcepitque servis suis medicis ut aromatibus condirent patrem.-->
And he commanded his servants the doctors to embalm his father with spices.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--3 Quibus jussa explentibus, transierunt quadraginta dies:-->
<!-- iste quippe mos erat cadaverum conditorum:-->
<!-- flevitque eum Ægyptus septuaginta diebus.-->
And while they fulfilled his decrees, 40 days passed;
as was naturally the custom for embalmed bodies:
and Egypt mourned him for 70 days.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--4 Et expleto planctus tempore, locutus est Joseph ad familiam Pharaonis:-->
<!-- Si inveni gratiam in conspectu vestro, loquimini in auribus Pharaonis:-->
And when the time of mourning was completed, Joseph said to Pharaoh's family:
If I have found favor in your sight, say so in Pharaoh's hearing:
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--5 eo quod pater meus adjuraverit me dicens:-->
<!-- En morior: 
     in sepulchro meo, quod fodi mihi in terra Chanaan, sepelies me.-->
<!-- Ascendam igitur, et sepeliam patrem meum, ac revertar.-->
For my father charged me, saying:
"Lo, I die; 
you will bury me in my tomb, which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan."
Therefore I will go up, and will bury my father, and then return.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--6 Dixitque ei Pharao: Ascende, et sepeli patrem tuum sicut adjuratus es.-->
And Pharaoh said to him:  Go up, and bury your father, as you were charged.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--7 Quo ascendente, ierunt cum eo omnes senes domus Pharaonis,-->
<!-- cunctique majores natu terræ Ægypti:-->
And as he went up, there went with him all the old men of the house of Pharaoh.
and every elder by birth of the land of Egypt:
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--8 domus Joseph cum fratribus suis,-->
<!-- absque parvulis, et gregibus atque armentis,-->
<!-- quæ dereliquerant in terra Gessen.-->
the house of Joseph with his brothers,
except for the children, and the flocks and herd,
which they left behind in the land of Goshen.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--9 Habuit quoque in comitatu currus et equites:-->
<!-- et facta est turba non modica.-->
Likewise he had in his company chariots and horsemen:
and it became a not small crowd.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--10 Veneruntque ad Aream Atad, quæ sita est trans Jordanem:-->
<!-- ubi celebrantes exequias planctu magno atque vehementi-->
<!-- impleverunt septem dies.-->
And they came to the Atad threshing floor, which lay across the Jordan:
where performing the funeral rites with great and vehement lamentation
took up seven days.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--11 Quod cum vidissent habitatores terræ Chanaan, dixerunt:-->
<!-- Planctus magnus est iste Ægyptiis.-->
<!-- Et idcirco vocatum est nomen loci illius, Planctus Ægypti.-->
After the inhabitants of the land of Canaan had seen this, they said:
That man was greatly mourned by the Egyptians.
And on that account the name of that place was called, Egypt's Lamentation.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--12 Fecerunt ergo filii Jacob sicut præceperat eis:-->
And so the sons of Jacob did as he had commanded them:
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--13 et portantes eum in terram Chanaan,-->
<!-- sepelierunt eum in spelunca duplici,-->
<!-- quam emerat Abraham cum agro in possessionem sepulchri ab Ephron Hethæo,-->
<!-- contra faciem Mambre.-->
and after carrying him into the land of Canaan,
they buried him in the double tomb,
that Abraham had bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite 
for the possession of a tomb,
opposite the face of Mambre.
