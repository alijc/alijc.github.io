<p>AJC
<!--16 Quibus ille respondit: Adducite pecora vestra, et dabo vobis pro eis --
  --cibos, si pretium non habetis.-->
And he answered them: Bring me your livestock, and I will give you food for
it, if you have no money.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--17 Quæ cum adduxissent, dedit eis alimenta pro equis, et ovibus, et --
  --bobus, et asinis: sustentavitque eos illo anno pro commutatione --
  --pecorum.-->
When they had brought it, he gave them provisions in return for their
horses, and sheep, and oxen, and asses: and he sustained them for that year
in exchange for their livestock.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--18 Venerunt quoque anno secundo, et dixerunt ei: Non celabimus dominum --
  --nostrum quod deficiente pecunia, pecora simul defecerunt: nec clam te --
  --est, quod absque corporibus et terra nihil habeamus.-->
Likewise, they came in the second year, and said to him: 
We'll not hide from our lord that our money is gone, 
and our livestock is gone too: nor is it unknown to thee,
that except for our bodies and our land, we have nothing.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--19 Cur ergo moriemur te vidente? et nos et terra nostra tui erimus: eme --
  --nos in servitutem regiam, et præbe semina, ne pereunte cultore --
  --redigatur terra in solitudinem.-->
Why shall we then die in thy sight?  
Both us and our land will be thine:
Buy us into the king's servitude,
and supply us with grain, lest, lacking tillers, 
the land be reduced to a wilderness.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--20 Emit igitur Joseph omnem terram Ægypti, vendentibus singulis --
  --possessiones suas præ magnitudine famis. Subjecitque eam Pharaoni,-->
Then Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, with each man selling his
possessions on account of the magnitude of the famine. 
And he placed it under Pharaoh.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--21 et cunctos populos ejus a novissimis terminis Ægypti usque ad --
  --extremos fines ejus,-->
also all of its people, from one end of Egypt to the other,
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--22 præter terram sacerdotum, quæ a rege tradita fuerat eis: quibus et --
  --statuta cibaria ex horreis publicis præbebantur, et idcirco non sunt --
  --compulsi vendere possessiones suas.-->
except for the land of the priests, which was bequeathed to them by the
king: and it had been established that they were to be supplied rations 
from the common store, and on that account they were not compelled to sell
their possessions.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--23 Dixit ergo Joseph ad populos: En ut cernitis, et vos et terram --
  --vestram Pharao possidet: accipite semina, et serite agros,-->
Then Joseph said to the people: Lo! just as you see, Pharaoh possesses both
you and your land: take seed, and sow the fields,
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--24 ut fruges habere possitis. Quintam partem regi dabitis: quatuor --
  --reliquas permitto vobis in sementem, et in cibum familiis et liberis --
  --vestris.-->
that you might have crops. You will give a fifth part to the king; the
remaining four parts are entrusted to you for planting, and for food for
your families and children.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--25 Qui responderunt: Salus nostra in manu tua est: respiciat nos tantum --
  --dominus noster, et læti serviemus regi.-->
And they replied: Our health is in thy hand:  
Let our lord pay us such great respect, 
and we will be glad and serve the king.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--26 Ex eo tempore usque in præsentem diem, in universa terra Ægypti --
  --regibus quinta pars solvitur, et factum est quasi in legem, absque --
  --terra sacerdotali, quæ libera ab hac conditione fuit.-->
From that time up to the present day, in all the land of Egypt
a fifth part is released to the king, just as if this was brought about in
law, except for the land of the priests, which was free of this condition.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--27 Habitavit ergo Israël in Ægypto, id est, in terra Gessen, et --
  --possedit eam: auctusque est, et multiplicatus nimis.-->
So Israel lived in Egypt, that is, in the land of Gessen, 
and was master of the land: and was increased and multiplied a great deal.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--28 Et vixit in ea decem et septem annis: factique sunt omnes dies vitæ --
  --illius, centum quadraginta septem annorum.-->
And he lived on that land seventeen years: and the days of his life were
accomplished, 147 years.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--29 Cumque appropinquare cerneret diem mortis suæ, vocavit filium suum --
  --Joseph, et dixit ad eum: Si inveni gratiam in conspectu tuo, pone manum --
  --tuam sub femore meo: et facies mihi misericordiam et veritatem, ut non --
  --sepelias me in Ægypto:-->
And when he sensed that the day of his death was near, he called his son
Joseph, and said to him: If I have found favor in thy sight, put thy hand
under my thigh: and thou wilt do for me mercy and truth, that I 
not be buried in Egypt:
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--30 sed dormiam cum patribus meis, et auferas me de terra hac, condasque --
  --in sepulchro majorum meorum. Cui respondit Joseph: Ego faciam quod --
  --jussisti.-->
but let me sleep with my fathers, and may thou carry me from this land, and
bury me in the sepulcher of my ancestors.  And Joseph answered him: I will
do what you have commanded.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--31 Et ille: Jura ergo, inquit, mihi. Quo jurante, adoravit Israël Deum, --
  --conversus ad lectuli caput.-->
And he said: Then swear it to me.  And while he swore, Israel turned to the
head of the bed and worshiped God.
