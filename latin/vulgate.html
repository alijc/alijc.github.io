<p>AJC
<!--12 Et statim Spiritus expulit eum in desertum.-->
And the Spirit straightway drove him out into the wilderness.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--13 Et erat in deserto quadraginta diebus, et quadraginta noctibus:
 et tentabatur a Satana: eratque cum bestiis, et angeli ministrabant illi.-->
And he was in the wilderness for forty days and forty nights:
and was tested by Satan: and was with the wild beasts, 
and angels attended to him.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--14 Postquam autem traditus est Joannes,
 venit Jesus in Galilæam, prædicans Evangelium regni Dei,-->
But after John was handed over,
Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the Gospel of the kingdom of God.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--15 et dicens: Quoniam impletum est tempus, et appropinquavit regnum Dei:
 pœnitemini, et credite Evangelio.-->
and saying: Since the time has been fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn
nigh, repent ye, and believe in the Gospel.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--16 Et præteriens secus mare Galilææ, vidit Simonem,
 et Andream fratrem ejus, mittentes retia in mare (erant enim piscatores),-->
And passing by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon,
and his brother Andrew, casting their nets into the sea (for they were
fishermen), 
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--17 et dixit eis Jesus: Venite post me,
 et faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum.-->
and Jesus said to them: Come after me,
and I will cause you to become fishers of men.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--18 Et protinus relictis retibus, secuti sunt eum.-->
And immediately abandoning their nets, they followed him.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--19 Et progressus inde pusillum, vidit Jacobum Zebedæi,
 et Joannem fratrem ejus, et ipsos componentes retia in navi:-->
And after he had gone on from there just a bit, he saw Jacob Zebedaiah,
and his brother John, and they were stowing their nets in their boat:
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--20 et statim vocavit illos.
 Et relicto patre suo Zebedæo in navi cum mercenariis, secuti sunt eum.-->
and he straightway called them.
And leaving their father Zebedaiah in the boat with the hired men,
they followed him.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--21 Et ingrediuntur Capharnaum: et statim sabbatis ingressus in synagogam,
 docebat eos.-->
And they entered Capharnaum: and on the Sabbath Jesus straightway entered 
the synagogue, and taught them.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--22 Et stupebant super doctrina ejus:
 erat enim docens eos quasi potestatem habens, et non sicut scribæ.-->
And they were astonished at his teaching:
for he was teaching them as if he had power, and not like the scribes.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--23 Et erat in synagoga eorum homo in spiritu immundo: et exclamavit,-->
And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit: and he shouted,
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--24 dicens: Quid nobis et tibi, Jesu Nazarene? venisti perdere nos?
 scio qui sis, Sanctus Dei.-->
saying: What is it for us and thee, Jesus of Nazareth? 
Habe you come to destroy us?
I know who you are, Holy Man of God.
