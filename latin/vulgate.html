<p>AJC
<!--25 Et comminatus est ei Jesus, dicens: Obmutesce, et exi de homine.-->
And Jesus threatened him, saying: Be quiet, and leave the man.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--26 Et discerpens eum spiritus immundus,
 et exclamans voce magna, exiit ab eo.-->
And the unclean spirit, rending the man 
and crying out in a loud voice, went out of him.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--27 Et mirati sunt omnes, ita ut conquirerent inter se dicentes:
 Quidnam est hoc? quænam doctrina hæc nova?
 quia in potestate etiam spiritibus immundis imperat, et obediunt ei.-->
And everyone was amazed, so that they asked among themselves, saying:
What in the world is this?  What is this new teaching?
for he commands even unclean spirits with authority, and they obey him.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--28 Et processit rumor ejus statim in omnem regionem Galilææ.-->
And his fame straightway spread forth into the whole region of Galile.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--29 Et protinus egredientes de synagoga,
 venerunt in domum Simonis et Andreæ, cum Jacobo et Joanne.-->
And they went out of the synagogue at once and
came to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--30 Decumbebat autem socrus Simonis febricitans:
 et statim dicunt ei de illa.-->
Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying down, ill with a fever;
and they tell him about her at once.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--31 Et accedens elevavit eam, apprehensa manu ejus:
 et continuo dimisit eam febris, et ministrabat eis.-->
And coming near, he raised her up and took her by the hand:
and the fever left her at once, and she served them.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--32 Vespere autem facto cum occidisset sol,
 afferebant ad eum omnes male habentes, et dæmonia habentes:-->
Now when evening had come and the sun had set,
they brought in to him all those who were ill, or who had demons:
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--33 et erat omnis civitas congregata ad januam.-->
and the whole town was gathered at the door.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--34 Et curavit multos, qui vexabantur variis languoribus,
 et dæmonia multa ejiciebat, et non sinebat ea loqui, quoniam sciebant eum.-->
And he healed many who were troubled with various diseases,
and cast out many demons, and did not allow them to speak, for they knew him.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--35 Et diluculo valde surgens,
 egressus abiit in desertum locum, ibique orabat.-->
And rising very early, 
he departed and went out into a deserted place, and prayed there.
