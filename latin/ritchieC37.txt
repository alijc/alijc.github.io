37. THE RESCUE OF HESIONE

Laōmedōn, cum hoc respōnsum renūntiātum esset, magnum dolōrem
percēpit; sed tamen, ut cīvēs suōs tantō perīculō līberāret, ōrāculō parēre
constituit et diem sacrificiō dīxit. Sed sīve cāsū sīve cōnsiliō deōrum
Herculēs tempore opportūnissimō Troiam attigit; ipsō enim temporis
pūnctō quō puella catēnīs vīncta ad lītus dēducēbātur ille nāvem appulit.
Herculēs ē nāvī ēgressus dē rēbus quae gerēbantur certior factus est; tum
īrā commōtus ad regem sē contulit et auxilium suum obtulit. Cum rēx
libenter eī concessisset ut, sī posset, puellam liberāret, Herculēs
mōnstrum interfēcit; et puellam, quae iam omnem spem salūtis
dēposuerat, incolumem ad patrem redūxit. Lāomedōn magnō cum gaudiō
fīliam suam accēpit, et Herculī prō tantō beneficiō meritam grātiam
rettulit.

START
AJC Laomedon, when this response had been announced, felt intense sorrow;
but nevertheless, in order to free his citizens from such great peril,
he decided to obey the oracle and named the day for the sacrifice.
But whether by chance or by the plan of the gods, Hercules reached
Troy at a most opportune time; for it was at the very instant
that he landed his ship that the girl, bound in chains, was being
led down to the shore.  Hercules disembarked and was informed of 
the things that were being carried out; then, provoked by rage,
he betook himself to the king and offered his help.
After the king had freely yielded to him so that, if he were able,
he might free the girl, Hercules slew the monster; and restored the
girl, who had already put aside all hope of salvation, back to her
father unharmed.  Laomedon accepted his daughter with great joy, and 
rendered all due thanks for such a great service.
