Proconsul Gnaeus Magnus sends greetings to General Cicero
If you are well, it is good.
I read your letter with pleasure;
for I recognized your former strength still in the public welfare.
The consuls, departing from Rome, came to the army that I kept in Apulia.
I encourage you greatly to seize the chance and carry yourself to us,
so that we might, through joint action, bring help and assistance to the 
unhappy republic.
I advise you to leave Rome, to travel along the Appian Way,
and to come as quick as you can to Brundisium.

General Caesar sends greetings to General Cicero
Although I am en route to Brundisium and am swiftly approaching it,
having already sent my army on ahead,
I nevertheless ought to write you and to give you proper thanks,
even though I have often done this and seem to be doing it more often;
you are so deserving.  Especially, 
since I believe that I will quickly come to the city,
I entreat you that I might see you there, so that I can make use of your advice,
position, and power.
Pardon the haste and brevity of my letter;
the rest you will learn from Furnius.
