 SI mors somnO similis est sEnsUsque exstinguuntur,
 dI bonI, quid lucrI est morI!-->

Smiling at her, the progenitor of men and of the gods,
who calms the weather and storms,
touched his lips to his daughter, and then speaks so well;
"Forbear from fear, Cytherean; the fates of your men remain unchanged
for you.  You will see the city and the promised walls of Lavinium
and you will carry the exalted Aeneas to the stars of the heavens;
nor does the opinion change me.
...
He will wage a vast war in Italy and quell the warlike nations
and erect walls and set character for men;
...
Romulus will follow the nation and restore the walls of Mars
and will name the Romans after himself.
For them I set neither the boundaries nor the limits of their affairs;
power beyond measure I have given. In fact the cruel Juno,
who now worries the sea and the lands and heaven with dread,
will return her resolutions for the better, and will favor 
the Romans, along with me, the masters of their affairs
and a people clad in togas."

If only amusement were desired of these literary pursuits, still, as I suppose, 
y'all would have judged this release of the mind to be
very refined and courteous.
For other things are of neither all seasons or ages or localities;
but these pursuits nourish youth, delight old age, 
furnish fortunate matters, offer refuge and solace to adversaries,
delight at home, don't hinder out of doors, spend the night, 
wander, and rusticate with us.

For years I built a monument more lasting than bronze.
