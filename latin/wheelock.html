‘C. Pompeius Trimalchio Maecenatianus rests here.
a sexvirate who was decreed to these absent from Rome.
Although he could be in every men's club in Rome, he didn't wish it.
Pious, strong, faithful, he rose from little;
he left 30 million sesterces, and didn't ever listen to a philosopher.
Farewell.  And you as well.'"
As Trimalchio said these words, Ubertim began to weep.
And Fortunata wept, and Habinnas too;
In the end the whole family, as if they'd been invited to a funeral,
lamentation filled the dining room.

Licinius, a slave of our Aesopus, has fled from Rome to Athens.
He was at Patro' house in Athens according to a free man.
Then he went away to Asia.  Afterwards Plato,
a certain man who is frequents Athens and who was there at the time
whennnnn Licinius had come to Athens,
received Aesopus' letter about Licinius,
He captured him in Ephesus and delivered him into custody.
I ask of you, brother, that you bring the slave back to Rome with you
when you sail from Ephesus.
For Aesopus is so angry on account of his slave's crime
that nothing could be more pleasing to him than to recover the fugitive.
