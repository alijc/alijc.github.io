  leave the city and to be escorted across the river to the mountains.
</p>

<p>EX 5 AJC The other authors once more began to move our spirits against the
  judgement and arguments of the senate, because all had been terrified by a new
  dread.  
</p>

<p>EX 6 AJC All kinds of servitude seem cruel to us.
</p>

<p>EX 7 AJC Won't Cicerone therefore be siezed from the hands of those wretches?
</p>

<p>EX 8 AJC What sort of end of dread and servitude can now be seen in the
  state? 
</p>

  thanks to the immortal gods.
</p>

<p>EX 13 AJC On account of the tyrant's kindnesses and common sense, few hated
  him. 
</p>

<p>SA 1 AJC Danger is never overcome without danger.
</p>

<p>SA 2 AJC Novius is my neighbor, and can be touched from my
  windows with my right hand. 
</p>

<p>SA 3 AJC Will not the judges order him, for his crimes, to be led in chains
  and carried away to his death? 
</p>

<p>SA 4 AJC Another age is worn out by civil wars, and Rome herself is blotted
  out by her own strength.
</p>

<p>SA 5 AJC But friendship is shut out of no place; it never is untimely or
  sinister; it holds many benefits. 
</p>

<p>SA 6 AJC Future things cannot be known.
</p>

<p>SA 7 AJC In the beginning the world itself was created for gods and men, and
  the things that are in it, they were prepared for the enjoyment of men. 
</p>

<p>SA 8 AJC How copiously is agriculture praised by Xenophon in the book that is
  entitled "Economics". 
</p>

<p>SA 9 AJC The rabble wants to be deceived.
</p>

<p>SA 10 AJC Where are knowledge and wisdom to be found?
</p>

<p>SA 11 AJC Truth too often struggles; it is never extinguished.
</p>

<p>TR 1 AJC There comes yet a great new age; from heaven is sent a boy, who will
  have the life of the gods and will see the gods and himself will be seen by
  them. 
</p>

<p>TR 2 AJC This boy will rule the world to which the virtues of the father gave
  peace. 
</p>

<p>TR 3 AJC A few evil things, however, will remain, which will force men to
  struggle and to wage bitter war. 
</p>

<p>TR 4 AJC There will be yet other wars and again to Troy will be sent the
  great Achilles. 
</p>

<p>TR 5 AJC Then, boy, when yet a long age will have made thee a man, there will
  be no struggles, no wars; sailors will come down from their ships; farmers too
  will leave their fields - the land itself will provide everything for all
  men. 
</p>

<p>TR 6 AJC Hurry ages; begin, little boy, to know your mother, and there will
  be enough breath for me to tell your deeds. 
</p>
