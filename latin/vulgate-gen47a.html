<!--1 Ingressus ergo Joseph nuntiavit Pharaoni, dicens:-->
Then Joseph went in and reported to Pharaoh, saying:
<!-- Pater meus et fratres, oves eorum et armenta,-->
My father and brothers, their sheep and their cattle,
<!-- et cuncta quæ possident, venerunt de terra Chanaan:-->
and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan:
<!-- et ecce consistunt in terra Gessen.-->
and lo they remain in the land of Gessen.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--2 Extremos quoque fratrum suorum quinque viros constituit coram rege:-->
He also brought his last five brothers into the presence of the king:
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--3 quos ille interrogavit: Quid habetis operis?-->
He asked them: What is your occupation?
<!-- Responderunt: Pastores ovium sumus servi tui, et nos et patres nostri.-->
They replied: We thy servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--4 Ad peregrinandum in terra tua venimus:-->
We came into thy country to sojourn in a strange land.
<!-- quoniam non est herba gregibus servorum tuorum,-->
because there is no grass for thy servants' flocks.
<!-- ingravescente fame in terra Chanaan:-->
with the famine growing heavier in the land of Canaan:
<!-- petimusque ut esse nos jubeas servos tuos in terra Gessen.-->
and we pray that thou order us thy servants to live in the land of Gessen.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--5 Dixit itaque rex ad Joseph:-->
And so the king said to Joseph:
<!-- Pater tuus et fratres tui venerunt ad te.-->
Thy father and thy brothers have come to thee.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--6 Terra Ægypti in conspectu tuo est:-->
The land of Egypt is within thy view:
<!-- in optimo loco fac eos habitare, et trade eis terram Gessen.-->
cause them to dwell in the best place, and deliver to them the land of Gessen.
<!-- Quod si nosti in eis esse viros industrios,-->
But if thou have found among them industrious men,
<!-- constitue illos magistros pecorum meorum.-->
set them up as masters of my flocks.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--7 Post hæc introduxit Joseph patrem suum ad regem,-->
After these things Joseph brought in his father to the king,
<!-- et statuit eum coram eo: qui benedicens illi,-->
and set him in his presence: and he blessed him,
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--8 et interrogatus ab eo: Quot sunt dies annorum vitæ tuæ?-->
and asked of him: How many are the days of the years of thy life?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--9 respondit:-->
he replied:
<!-- Dies peregrinationis meæ centum triginta annorum sunt,-->
The days of my wanderings are one hundred and thirty,
<!-- parvi et mali, et non pervenerunt usque ad dies patrum meorum-->
few, and ill, and they don't come up to the days of my fathers
<!-- quibus peregrinati sunt.-->
which were spent in wandering.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--10 Et benedicto rege, egressus est foras.-->
And after he blessed the king, he went outside.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--11 Joseph vero patri et fratribus suis dedit possessionem in Ægypto-->
Indeed Joseph gave his father and brothers property in Egypt
<!-- in optimo terræ loco, Ramesses, ut præceperat Pharao.-->
in the best place in the land, Ramesses, just as Pharaoh had instructed.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--12 Et alebat eos, omnemque domum patris sui, præbens cibaria singulis.-->
And he nourished them, and all of his father's house, 
supplying food to each one.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--13 In toto enim orbe panis deerat,-->
For bread was wanting in the whole world,
<!-- et oppresserat fames terram, maxime Ægypti et Chanaan.-->
and famine had overwhelmed the land, especially Egypt and Canaan.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--14 E quibus omnem pecuniam congregavit pro venditione frumenti,-->
He collected from them all the money for selling grain,
<!-- et intulit eam in ærarium regis.-->
and brought it into the king's treasury.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--15 Cumque defecisset emptoribus pretium,-->
And when the price to the buyers fell short,
<!-- venit cuncta Ægyptus ad Joseph, dicens:-->
all Egypt came to Joseph, saying:
<!-- Da nobis panes: quare morimur coram te, deficiente pecunia?-->
Give us bread: why should we die in thy presence, lacking money.
