36. LAOMEDON AND THE SEA-MONSTER
Laōmedon quīdam illō tempore rēgnum Troiae obtinēbat. Ad hunc 1
Neptūnus et Apollō annō superiōre vēnerant, et cum Troia nōndum
moenia habēret, ad hoc opus auxilium obtulerant. Postquam tamen
hōrum auxiliō moenia cōnfecta sunt, nōlēbat Lāomedōn praemium
quod prōposuerat persolvere.

Neptūnus igitur et Apollō ob hanc causam īrātī mōnstrum
quoddam mīserunt speciē horribilī, quod cotīdie ē marī veniēbat et
hominēs pecudēsque vorābat. Troiānī autem timōre perterritī in
urbe continēbantur, et pecora omnia ex agrīs intrā murōs
compulerant. Lāomedōn hīs rēbus commōtus ōrāculum cōnsuluit, 10
ac deus eī praecēpit ut fīliam Hēsiōnen mōnstrō obiceret.

Neptunus igitur et Apollo ob hanc causam irati monstrum quoddam miserunt specie
horribili, quod cottidie e mari veniebat et homines pecudesque vorabat. Troiani
autem timore perterriti in urbe continebantur, et pecora omnia ex agris intra
muros compulerant. Laomedon his rebus commotus oraculum consuluit, ac deus ei
praecepit ut filiam Hesionem monstro obiceret.

At that time a certain Laomedon held the kingdom of Troy.
Neptune and Apollo had come to him the year before, and 
since Troy as yet had no fortifications, had offered 
their aid with this work.  With their help, the walls 
were finished after a mere hour, but Laomedon wasn't 
willing to pay the price that they had proposed.

Now Neptune and Apollo were enraged by this and sent a certain monster
of a horrible sort, that used to come out of the sea every day and devour
men and livestock.  The Trojans, terrified with fear, would stay in the
city, and had gathered all their herds from the fields to within the
walls.  Laomedon was troubled by these things and consulted an oracle,
and the god ordered him to cast his daughter Hesione to the monster.
