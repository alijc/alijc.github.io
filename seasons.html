<h1>Seasons of Love</h1>
<i>(Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes)<br>
(Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear)</i><br>
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes<br>
How do you measure, measure a year?<br>
<br>
(In daylights, in sunsets)         Ooh<br>
(In midnights, in cups of coffee)  Ooh<br>
(In inches, in miles)              Ah - laughter, in strife<br>

In five hundred twenty-five thousand Six hundred minutes<br>
(How do you measure)	Ooh<br>
- year in the life?<br>
How about love?  How about love?<br>
How about love?  Measure in love<br>
Seasons of love  Love<br>
Seasons of love <br>
Oo Oo<br>
|||| <br>
Oo  Ooh Ah<br>
No day but today<br>
I can't control <br>
my destiny<br>
I trust my soul, <br>
my only goal <br>
is just to be<br>
Without you<br>
 the hand gropes<br>
 the ear hears<br>
 the pulse beats<br>
 life goes on<br>
 but I'm gone<br>
 cause I die  without you<br>
 I die without you<br>
 I die  without you<br>
 I die  without you<br>
 I die  without you<br>
No day but today.
