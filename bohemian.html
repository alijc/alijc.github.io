<h1>Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
Is this the real life? Is it just fantasy?<br>
Caught in a landslide no escape from reality.<br>
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see.<br>
Oo, poor boy, because it's<br>
Easy come, easy go ------ little low<br>
Oo, the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.<br>
<br>
<i>....thrown it all away</i>  Mama, ooh<br>
Didn't mean to make you cry, if I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br>
Carry on, carry on   ---- </br>
<br>
<i>Mama, ooh</i> Any way the wind blows Ooh.<br>
x Ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
<br>
I see a little silhouetto of a man<br>
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, can you do the fandango<br>
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightning, me!<br>
---- Galileo ---- Galileo, Galileo, Figaro ----- X X Oh! X <br>
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me<br>
He is just a poor boy, from a poor family<br>
Spare him his life from this monostrosity<br>
---- Bismillah! No, we will not let him go!<br>
Bismillah! We will not let you go!<br>
Bismillah! We will not let you go!<br>
---- will not let you go! ---- will not let you go! X X Oh!<br>
no, no, no, no, no, no, no Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go!<br>
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for ME!<br>
<br>
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?<br>
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?<br>
Oh, baby, can't do this to me baby.  <br>
Gotta get out, gotta get right out of here<br>
<br>
Ooh, oh yeah, oh yeah<br>
<br>
Nothing really matters ----- <br>
------- Nothing really matters to me<br>
<br>
Any way the wind blows<br>
